# Hoteladvisor

Built a hotel review web application that allow users to post, view, edit and delete hotel reviews and comments, and view hotel locations with the embedded mapbox map.

Established models and templates with ExpressJs to perform CRUD operations.

Utilized Mongoose to store hotel information, reviews and comments in MongoDB.

Improved interactivity by using Mapbox APIs to embed mapbox map and connect-flash to show flash message.
